Great fleas have little fleas
Upon their backs to bite â€™em,
And little fleas have lesser fleas,
And so ad infinitum.
And the great fleas them selves, in turn,
Have greater fleas to go on;
While these again have greater still
And greater still, and so on.

and this is my poem isn't that

Apple is green
