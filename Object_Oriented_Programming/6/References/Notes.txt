1). In C++ the Destructer is called when the object scope is over. So to avoid destructer calling try to pass the reference
    of the object whenever possible

2). When we write 
		cout<<"My Lucky Number is:"<<n<<" Number"; 

then first cout<<"\nMy Lucky Number" goes for processing and returns cout:-
		
like		cout<<n 

is made and the cout<<n goes for processing... Then again cout is returned and it becomes like:-

		cout<<" Number";

then this go to processing.

So in the c++ program here in operator overloading of << we have returned a reference to ostream class "out" so that 
when it is processed out is again returned. Here we returned "out" which is same as "cout" . We have named "out" reference.
